Hi!
Iâ€™m Shivansh, and I am interested primarily in the multidisciplinary domain of Digital Economy.
I am particularly interested in understanding how technology and digital platforms shape human behaviour, economic incentives, and societal outcomes. I aim to uncover structural biases and social dynamics using large-scale data, with the goal of helping build more inclusive, transparent, and responsible digital ecosystems.

At the moment, I am working as a **Research Associate** at the **Indian School of Business**, with [Professor Vasundhara Sharma](https://www.isb.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/vasundhara-sharma).

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Prior Experiences</b>: Over the past seven years, I've designed ML pipelines at an analytics startup, a fintech product company, and a major consulting firm. My experience spans credit risk and customer lifecycle modeling, automated insight generation from social listening, and forecasting. Further details about my skills and experience are available in my <a target="_self" href="/cv/">CV</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am interested in AI's potential to navigate social settings. My primary focus is on real-world interactions, where AI can help us make socially conscious decisions while mitigating harmful societal influences. Furthermore, through autonomous AI decision-making, I aim to augment human capabilities in managing situations beyond our control, such as interactions with other AI agents or unpredictable environmental events.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm deeply concerned about the insidious inequities perpetuated by evolving and persistent dogmas that infiltrate AI-powered products and services. Data-driven AI tools can unknowingly perpetuate our own ill-founded and often-forgotten biases. Even when we identify, rectify, and evolve beyond these biases, most of our transcripts reflect outdated beliefs. These older, biases form the omnipresent machine learning and data pipelines, exacerbating the problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, it is paramount that AI learns to evolve and adapt with us, or even better, facilitates our positive evolution!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My explorations have shown that we are quite good at adapting to changes, both big and small. The recent global economic comeback serves as compelling evidence of this! However, unlike humans, current RL agents find it challenging to cope with the non-stationarity inherent in real-life scenarios.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, as a first step to instill human-like resilience in AI,  I aim to study domains and problems that highlight our capacity to adapt, such as music creation, driving in traffic, and business market interactions, among others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Human adaptability provides a relevant and accessible starting point for addressing this challenge. The vast amount of data we generate daily offers a rich resource for studying these adaptive strategies. However, I believe that human learning is not the only effective approach. The ability to adjust to environmental changes is a fundamental property throughout the natural world, and studying these diverse adaptive mechanisms can reveal more sophisticated and subtle strategies.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update!</h3>

- I am looking out for PhD positions!. Please feel free to reach out if you believe we could be a great team!
- [04-26-2025] Submitted our paper: IEEE Access journal "Inducing Persona in Negotiations Between Agents in Generative AI Applications: Exploring Vulnerabilities and Emergent Dynamics"
- [12-23-2024] My paper got accepted at AAAI-25 MARW workshop: "Unraveling Complex Sequential Social Dilemmas: In a Risky World with A2C Decision Transformer" 

Note
======
Why do I believe in adaptive equity?
Simply because a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient or even counterproductive in the face of changing circumstances, diverse needs, and evolving social norms.

Is adaptive equity the only goal of my journey?
No, I expect my goals and journey to evolve. However, outcome optimization is a core principle I strongly believe in, and one that will likely guide me for years to come. These outcomes can be driven by multiple objectives. For instance, increasing profitability and equity for a product company are not mutually exclusive.
