Hi!
I’m Shivansh, and I am interested primarily in the multidisciplinary domain of Digital Economy.

At the moment, I am working as a **Research Associate** at the **Indian School of Business**, with [Professor Vasundhara Sharma](https://www.isb.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/vasundhara-sharma).

<h3 >Research Insterests</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am particularly interested in understanding how technology and digital platforms shape human behaviour, economic incentives, and societal outcomes. I aim to uncover structural biases and social dynamics using large-scale data, to help build more inclusive, transparent, and responsible digital ecosystems..</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am fascinated by how digital platforms mediate interactions, shape incentives, and influence both individual behaviour and collective outcomes. As technology becomes more embedded in our everyday decisions—what we read, where we go, whom we trust—understanding these systems is no longer optional; it’s essential.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My current research focuses on platform governance, reputation mechanisms, and user reviews—tools that claim to promote trust and transparency, but often conceal deeper social dynamics and structural inequities. These systems are far from neutral, and I strongly believe data-driven research can help surface these hidden patterns and inform better, more inclusive design.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Though this is just the initial steps, I would like to start by understanding "what", then ask "why" these patterns emerge and "how" can we help platforms evolve responsibly in the face of shifting user behaviours.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Prior Experiences</b>: During the year and a half after earning my degree in Petroleum Engineering, I worked as a Data Scientist at HCLTech, where I developed machine learning solutions for clients such as Chevron and ExxonMobil. My work focused on creating and optimising data ingestion pipelines and building predictive models for asset management and maintenance analytics. This hands-on industry experience deepened my interest in how data-driven technologies impact organisations and people, ultimately leading me to transition into Information Systems and computational social science research. Further details about my skills and experience are available in my <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/gshivansh.github.io//cv/">CV</a>. </p>

<h3>Personal Interests</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond my academic work, I love exploring the latest advancements in technology and the societal shifts they bring — some of which I write about in my <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/gshivansh.github.io//year-archive/">blog</a> and find joy in writing poetry, observing human behavior in everyday life, and of course — movies! You can explore more of these personal interests on the <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/gshivansh.github.io//teaching/">Beyond Research</a> section of my site.
